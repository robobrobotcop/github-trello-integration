Version 1.0 of a GitHub Trello integration that hopefully will help give a better overlook of open pull requests and their statuses.

Built to make my (QA) workflow easier so if cards are created/moved to and from Approved, On Hold or Open on Trello is based on labels, mainly the On Hold and QA OK labels that we use on GitHub.

Will be run manually to start with. Goal is to clean it up and move it to a micro service where it will run every 5 minutes or so.
