Version 1.1 of a GitHub to Trello integration that hopefully will help give a better overlook of open pull requests and their statuses.

Built to make our (QA) workflow easier so if cards are created/moved to and from Draft, Approved, On Hold or Open on Trello is based on labels, mainly the Draft, On Hold and QA OK labels that we use on GitHub. When PRs are merged in Github they are archived in Trello.

Includes a "blacklist" for Repos so you don't have to include all PRs from all Repos you have access to.
